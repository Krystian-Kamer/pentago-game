      <p>
        Hello, this is a pentago game. My name is{' '}
        <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Krystian Kamer</span>. I have been
        passionate about board games since childhood and for the past two years
        <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}> programming</span>.
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
        I have this game on the shelf and I really wanted to replicate its
        mechanism. I created the game from scratch, using HTML, CSS and React.
