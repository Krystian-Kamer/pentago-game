<h2>Pentago Game</h2>
* I present my first project in React. This is a game for two players.
* This is full responsive website.
* In game Options You can change player color, player name, You can also change background to random or set default background.
* In Rules You have... rules, so how to play this game.
* In About You will find out how to contact me.
* I used localStorage, so if You don't have time to finish game You can simply back to this game later and then defeat your opponent.

* To recreate the site locally, just clone my repository and type npm install in terminal and then npm run dev (because I used Vite).

Feel free to explore my site and if You have any questions You can simply write to me.
