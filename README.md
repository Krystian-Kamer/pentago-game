<h2>Pentago Game ðŸª©</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Project was created by using React. </li>
  <li>This is a game for two players. </li>
  <li>It's a full responsive website.</li>
  <li>In game Options You can change player color, player name, You can also change background to random or set default background.</li>
  <li>In Rules You have... rules, so how to play this game.</li>

  <li>I used localStorage, so if You don't have time to finish game You can simply back to this game later and then defeat your opponent.</li>

</ul>
